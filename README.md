Countdowner
==

Countdowner is a simple countdown application for iOS 5.0+.  This is for educational purposes as my brother is learning how to program (specifically for iOS) and was looking for a starting point.

  - Select a time from the `UIDatePicker` UI component.
  - Alert is shown when timer is up.
  - Uses Automatic Reference Counting
  - Does not use Interface Builder or a Storboard (all UI components are created programmatically).
  - Fully commented code for noobs.
